This paper focuses on applying gamification, the use of game elements in non-game human interaction systems, in order to improve the security and usability of CAPTCHA systems. We propose to use movie-based quizzes to achieve a Gamified CAPTCHA system that employs the human capability to recognize the strangeness of a short movie story.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent progress in AI powered by deep learning in solving narrow tasks, we are not close to human intelligence in its flexibility, versatility, and efficiency. Efficient learning and effective generalization come from inductive biases, and building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is an exercise in finding the right set of inductive biases that make fast learning possible while being general enough to be widely applicable in tasks that humans excel at. To make progress in AGI, we argue that we can look at the human brain for such inductive biases and principles of generalization. To that effect, we propose a strategy to gain insights from the brain by simultaneously looking at the world it acts upon and the computational framework to support efficient learning and generalization. We present a neuroscience-inspired generative model of vision as a case study for such approach and discuss some open problems about the path to AGI.}

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, because of the undeniable impact of the Internet on all aspects of human life, security preserving has received more attention. To reach an acceptable level of security, Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computer and Human Apart or simply CAPTCHA as a security preserving tool has been tailored for situations that need to prevent bots from doing a specific action; for example, signing up and downloading. Simultaneously, it should be also designed in such a way to allow humans to perform the same action. Despite its advantageous applications, there are several important issues such as security, usability, and accessibility that make its use controversial. In this paper, attempts were made to do a comprehensive review on various aspects and state-of-the-art of CAPTCHA in general and its alternatives in particular to help researchers easily focus on specific issues for the sake of proposing new solutions and ideas. Regarding the advancement in CAPTCHA development, new classifications were proposed to categorize different variations of CAPTCHAs and their problems and then compare them. Moreover, different types of CAPTCHAs' alternatives were classified and evaluated by introducing several proposed measures. This evaluation could come in handy for future studies that aim to develop new techniques for overcoming current deficiencies. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
