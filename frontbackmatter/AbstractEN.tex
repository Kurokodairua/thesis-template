	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Reducing the usage of resources is essential when maintaining a website. 
	“Completely automated public turing tests to tell computers and humans apart”, in short CAPTCHA, are often used to prevent attacks from malicious bots. 
	The completion of these tests is often complicated and disrupts the usage of the website. 

	In the following paper we look at different techniques to tell humans and computers apart and how they influence the development and usage of websites and their security. 
	
	For this purpose we design an evaluation matrix to rate different methods regarding their effort to complete, their accessibility, their technical feasibility and their security. 
	
	Based on this evaluation we look at different fields of use to determine which CAPTCHA method is the best option overall.
