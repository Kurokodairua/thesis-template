	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Reducing the usage of resources is essential when maintaining a website. 
	“Completely automated public turing tests to tell computers and humans apart”, in short CAPTCHA, are often used to prevent attacks from malicious bots. 
	The completion of these tests is often complicated and disrupts the usage of the website. 

	In the following paper we look at different techniques to tell humans and computers apart and how they influence the development and usage of websites and their security. 
	
	For this purpose we design an evaluation matrix to rate different methods regarding their simplicity to complete, their accessibility, their technical feasibility and their security. 
	
	Based on this evaluation we look at different fields of use to determine which CAPTCHA method is the best option overall.

	CAPTCHAs with minor amounts of inputs needed from the user, like reCAPTCHA v3 or hCaptcha, score very high in all categories and are a good choice,
	even with emphasis on different aspects.  

	Other CAPTCHAs can also be a solid choice in some cases.

	Some kinds of CAPTCHAs are not used very often in current times. 
	Because of this, they scored very low or weren't not considered any further.
